Mock amazon app using node and mysql


*__What the project does:__ This is an app was created using Node and mysql. the application is a mock version of amazon and is setup so that the developer creates a "products" database in mysql and populates it with products. The developer then creates a connection to the database in node and then prompts the user in the terminal to make purchases. The purchase will update the database b decrimenting the puchased items from the inventory in the database.

*__Why the project is useful:__ Building this app was useful because it helps the developer learn how to use mysql and node together to be able to get information from the database and update the database with node.
